<h1>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Cloudmesh is an important component to deliver a software-defined
system – encompassing virtualized and bare-metal infrastructure,
networks, application, systems and platform software – with a unifying
goal of providing Cloud Testbeds as a Service (CTaaS). Cloudmesh
federates a number of resources from academia and industry. This
includes existing FutureGrid infrastructure (4704 cores used by more
than 355 projects), Amazon Web Services, Azure, HP Cloud, Karlsruhe
using various technologies.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/cloudmesh-arch-2013.png"><img alt="cloudmesh architecture" src="_images/cloudmesh-arch-2013.png" style="width: 540.75px; height: 555.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure:</strong> The cloudmesh architecture. Green = components available, under improvement. Yellow = components under development.</p>
</div>
<p>A goal of Cloudmesh is to aggregate resources not only from
FutureGrid, but also from OpenCirrus, Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and HP
Cloud and GENI resources to name only a few. Cloudmesh was originally
developed in order to simplify the execution of multiple concurrent
experiments on a federated cloud infrastructure. In addition to
virtual resources, FG exposes bare-metal provisioning to users, but
also a subset of HPC monitoring infrastructure tools. Services will be
available through command line, API, and Web interfaces.</p>
<p>The three layers of the Cloudmesh architecture include a Cloudmesh
Management Framework for monitoring and operations, user and project
management, experiment planning and deployment of services needed by
an experiment, Provisioning and execution environments to be deployed
on resources (or interfaced with) to enable experiment management, and
resources.</p>
<div class="section" id="system-monitoring-and-operations">
<h2>System Monitoring and Operations<a class="headerlink" href="#system-monitoring-and-operations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The management framework contains services to facilitate FG day-to-day
operation, including federated or selective monitoring of the
infrastructure. Cloudmesh leverages the FG for the operational
services and allow administrators to view ongoing system status and
experiments, as well as interact with users through ticket systems and
messaging queues to inform subscribed users on the status of the
system.</p>
<p>The cloudmesh management framework offers services that simplify
integration of resources in the FG nucleus or through federation. This
includes, for user management, access to predefined setup templates
for services in enabling resource and service provisioning as well as
experiment execution. To integrate IaaS frameworks cloudmesh offers
two distinct services:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><ol class="first loweralpha">
<li>a federated IaaS frameworks hosted on FutureGrid,</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><ol class="first loweralpha" start="2">
<li>the availability of a service that is hosted on FG allowing the</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“integration” of IaaS frameworks through user credentials either
registered by the users or automatically obtained from our distributed
user directory. For (b) several toolkits exist to create user-based
federations, including our own abstraction level which supports
interoperability via libcloud, but more importantly it supports
directly the native OpenStack protocol and overcomes limitations of
the EC2 protocol and the libcloud compatibility layer. Plugins that we
currently develop will enable access to clouds via firewall
penetration, abstraction layers for clouds with few public IP
addresses and integration with new services such as OpenStack Heat. We
successfully federated resources from Azure, AWS, the HP cloud,
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Cloud, and four FutureGrid clouds
using various versions of OpenStack and Eucalyptus. The same will be
done for OpenCirrus resources at GT and CMU through firewalls or proxy
servers.</p>
<p>Additional management flexibility will be introduced through automatic
cloud-bursting and shifting services. While cloud bursting will locate
empty resources in other clouds, cloud shifting will identify unused
services and resources, shut them down and provision them with
services that are requested by the users. We have demonstrated this
concept in 2012, moving resources for ~100 users to services that were
needed based on class schedules. A reservation system will be used to
allow for reserved creation of such environments, along with
improvements of automation of cloud-shifting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-and-project-services">
<h2>User and Project Services<a class="headerlink" href="#user-and-project-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>FG user and project services simplify the application processes needed
to obtain user accounts and projects. We have demonstrated in FG the
ability to create accounts in a very short time, including vetting
projects and users – allowing fast turn-around times for the majority
of FG projects with an initial startup allocation. Cloudmesh re-use
this infrastructure and also allows users to manage proxy accounts to
federate to other IaaS services to provide an easy interface to
integrate them.</p>
<div class="section" id="accounting-and-app-store">
<h3>Accounting and App Store<a class="headerlink" href="#accounting-and-app-store" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To lower the barrier of entry cloudmesh will be providing a shopping
cart will allow checking out of predefined repeatable experiment
templates. A cost is associated with an experiment making it possible
to engage in a careful planning and to save time by reusing previous
experiments. Additionally, the Cloudmesh App Store may function as a
clearing-house of images, image templates, services offered and
provisioning templates. Users may package complex deployment
descriptions in an easy parameter/form-based interface and other users
may be able to replicate the specified setup with.</p>
<p>Due to our advanced Cloudmesh Metrics framework we are in the position
to further develop an integrated accounting framework allowing a usage
cost model for users and management to identify the real impact of an
experiment on resources. This will be useful to avoid overprovisioning
and inefficient resource usage. The cost model will be based not only
on number of core hours used, but also the capabilities of the
resource, the time and special support it takes to set up the
experiment. We will expand upon the metrics framework of FutureGrid
that allows measuring of VM and HPC usage and associate this with cost
models. Benchmarks will be used to normalize the charge models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="networking">
<h3>Networking<a class="headerlink" href="#networking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have a broad vision of resource integration in FG with systems
offering different levels of control from &#8220;bare metal&#8221; to use of a
portion of a resource. Likewise, we must utilize networks offering
various levels of control, from standard IP connectivity to completely
configurable SDNs as novel cloud architectures will almost certainly
leverage NaaS and SDN alongside system software and middleware. FG
resources will make use of SDN using OpenFlow whenever possible and
the same level of networking control will not be available in every
location.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="monitoring">
<h3>Monitoring<a class="headerlink" href="#monitoring" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To serve the purposes of CISE researchers, cloudmesh must be able to
access empirical data about the properties and performance of the
underlying infrastructure beyond what is available from commercial
cloud environments. To accommodate this requirement we have developed
a uniform access interface to virtual machine monitoring information
available for OpenStack and Eucalyptus, and Nimbus. In Future, we will
be enhancing the access to historical user information. Right now they
are exposed through predefined reports that we create on a regular
basis. Tho achieve this we will also leverage the ongoing work while
using the AMPQ protocol. Furthermore, Cloudmesh will provide access to
common monitoring infrastructure as provided by Ganglia, Nagios, Inca,
perfSonar, PAPI and others.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="role-and-use-of-standards-and-open-source-software">
<h3>Role and Use of Standards and Open Source Software<a class="headerlink" href="#role-and-use-of-standards-and-open-source-software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cloudmesh will use standards and open source software as part of its
design principles towards sustainability into. We will leverage
efforts such as OCCI and CDMI and are already using community efforts
on interoperability APIs as provided by Apache libcloud. However, as
libcloud is feature limited cloudmesh provides and additional
abstraction layer that exposes cloud interfaces on the native-protocol
level. Furthermore we interface to commercial Clouds such as Microsoft
Azure, Amazon WS, and HP Cloud to providing access to robust
commercial high availability services.</p>
