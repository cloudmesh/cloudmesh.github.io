We have supported multiple academic clouds and provided access to them via Cloudmesh.
The current version is available for

* AWS
* Azure
* Goggle

* OpenStack (Chameleon Cloud, Jeststream) 

In the past we also supported several academic and commercial clouds including

* Jetstream
* FutureSystems

* Cybera (Canada)
* FutureGrid
* KIT  Cloud (Karlsruhe)
* HPE OpenStack
* OpenCirrus
* GENI
* Any EC2 cloud, including Eucalyptus

We have included here the summary of the older varsions, as they still
include some valuble contributions. THis includes A portal framework
for Cloudmesh and HPC interfaces to queuing systems such as PBS and
SLURM,

For the portal we have provoded a number of screenshots. The important
part is that from beginning on a multicloud development kit, API and
command shell.

Cloudmesh was also the first toolkit that provided bare metal
provisioning as part of an acadeic cloud. The system was called Rain.
