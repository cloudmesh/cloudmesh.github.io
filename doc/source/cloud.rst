IaaS
======================================================================

Cloudmesh IaaS abstratcions provides a convenient set of interfaces to
various clouds.  Currently we focus on virtual machine management, but
a future version will include other services.

Interfaces
---------------------------

The Cloudmesh core interfaces include 

:API: A python API that simplifies access to clouds while being able o
      use the native cloud protocols and not just an EC2 compatibility
      mode as is provided by libcloud or boto.  However, we are also
      providing an EC2 interface based on libcloud, making it possible
      to integrate easily the many clouds supported by it.

:Shell: A command shell allows the easy interaction with various
        clouds while using simple commands. As the commands can be
        included in scripts, it can also help to formulate simple
        experiment templates.

:Commands: The shell commands can also be used on the Unix command line.
           Making it possible to integrate cloudmesh features into the
           unix ecosystem
           
:Web UI: We are providing on FutureGrid an example for a hosted mode
         of cloudmesh.
       
:Console UI: It is possible to host cloudmesh on your own computer. This
       	may be desirable, if you like to customize the interfaces. We
       	like to hear back from you if you use it in this fashion. We
       	like to also integrate your new components and features into
       	cloudmesh. If you like to become a developer, please contact
       	laszewski@gmail.com
      
:iPython: We are currently developing a set of simple examples to let
          users know how easy it is to use the API.

Integration of External Clouds
---------------------------------

Currently we support the native OpenStack and the EC2 protocol. This
allows you to integrate a large number of clouds. Hence it is possible
to not only integrate FutureGrid Cloud resources. However, some clouds
require you to use a certificate.  In this case you can talk to us.

We have demonstrated successfully the integration with

* OpenStack Grizzly clouds, an example is sierra.futuregrid.org 
* EC2 OpenStack cloud, an example is alamo.futuregrid.org
* HP Cloud East
* HP Cloud West
* Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
* Azure (standalone mode)
* AWS (standalone mode)

Although we have demonstrated that it is possible to integrate with
cloudmesh we have not yet exposed this feature by default to the
users. Users are welcome to try it.
