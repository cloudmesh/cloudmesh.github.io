Cloudmesh Twister2 Interface
============================

-  This project can also be taken as independent study or as part of the
   Cloud Engineering class

Goals
-----

In this project you will be developing a framework in python that allows
us to use twister2 features. The project will include the design of a
Python API and/or services so that twister2 functionality can easily be
accessed from Python.

The design will be based on Python APIs and REST services. The REST
services will be written with the hel of OpenAPI allowing not only the
development of clients written in Python, but also in a number of other
languages, while leveraging automated REST service API code generators

Relevant links will be posted here shortly:

Requirements
------------

-  Strong knowledge of Java and Python
-  Weekly activities and progress is required
-  Minimum project related work hours per week 6 - 12 hours

Difficulty
----------

*difficult*: Twister2 is a large pacake, you will be asked to provide a
subset of functionality that is determined by talking to Gregor von
Laszewski.

Deliverables
------------

-  Working benchmarks in form of reproducable workflows embedded in
   pytests
-  checkins into github by all team members. If only one team member
   checks in all other team members will not get credit.
-  benchmark of the tasks while reporting the results into the database
-  Definition of the objects stored in the database.
-  This project will not require you to write a report, buut a manual
   page and documented source code
