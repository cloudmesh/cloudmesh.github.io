Note
-------

Although this Web page is still relevant and mostly up to
date, we are doing some improvements to it.

Importnat to note is that we have two valid cloudmesh versions and
dependent on needs you need to chose the one or the other. We have

* Version 3: which is our classical cloudmesh and has the most
  functionality
* Client: which is a newer version, but does not yet have all the
  functionality

We currently also have a development version that merges Version 3 and
Client functionality that we call Version 4.

In addition We are working on a new look of our Web page and have a
prototype available at

* https://cloudmesh-community.github.io/
  
This Web page has links to Educational material and projects as well
as sumamrizes some of the newer community developments.

   * - Cloudmesh an On-ramp to Clouds 
     - Cloudmesh can be used as an on-ramp to clouds and even HPC
       services. This makes it possible to use Azure, AWS, OpenStack,

       framework easily.
