   Description:

    Please note that some values are read from the cloudmesh.yaml file.
    One such value is cloudmesh.profile.user

    Management of public keys is an essential component of accessing
    virtual machines in the cloud. There are a number of sources where
    you can find public keys. This includes the ~/.ssh directory and for
    example github. If you do not already have a public-private key pair
    they can be generated using cloudmesh

       key gen ssh 
           This will create the public-private keypair of ~/.ssh/id_rsa
           and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in OpenSSH format

       key gen pem 
           This will create the public-private keypair of ~/.ssh/id_rsa
           and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in PEM format

       key gen (ssh | pem) --filename=~/.cloudmesh/foobar
           This will generate the public-private key pair of 
           ~/.cloudmesh/foobar and ~/.cloudmesh/foobar.pub

       key gen (ssh | pem) --filename=~/.cloudmesh/foobar --set_path
           This will generate the keys as stated above, but it will
           also set cloudmesh to use these keys for encryption.

    Keys can also be verified for their formatting and passwords. By
    default cloudmesh checks ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub If the
    key is password protected the formatting can only be verified if the
    password is provided (--check_pass argument)

       key verify pem
           Verifies that ~/.ssh/id_rsa has PEM format

       key verify ssh --pub
           Verifies that ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub has OpenSSH format

       key verify pem --filename=~/.cloudmesh/foobar
           Verifies if the private key located at ~/.cloudmesh/foobar
           is password protected

       key verify pem --filenam=~/.cloudmesh/foobar --check_pass
           Request the password to the file, then checks if the
           key is in proper PEM format

    You may find the need to keep the values of your keys but different
    encodings or formats. These aspects of your key can also be changed
    using cloudmesh.

       key reformat pem
           Will reformat the ~/.id_rsa.pub key from PEM to OpenSSH

       key reformat ssh
           Will reformat the ~/.id_rsa.pub key from OpenSSH to PEM

       key reformat --filename=~/.id_rsa --format=PKCS8
           Will reformat the private key to PKCS8 format

    Keys will be uploaded into cloudmesh database with the add command
    under the given NAME. If the name is not specified the name
    cloudmesh.profile.user is assumed.

        key add NAME  --source=ssh
            adds the default key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        key add NAME  --source=FILENAME
            adds the key specified by the filename with the given name
        key add NAME --git --username=username
            adds a named github key from a user with the given github
            username.

        key set
            adds the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key with the name specified in
            cloudmesh.profile.user.
            It also sets the variable key to that user.


    Once the keys are uploaded to github, they can be listed To list
    these keys the following list functions are provided.

        key list --source=git  [--username=USERNAME]
            lists all keys in git for the specified user. If the
            name is not specified it is read from cloudmesh.yaml
        key list --source=ssh  [--dir=DIR] [--output=OUTPUT]
            lists all keys in the directory. If the directory is not
            specified the default will be ~/.ssh

        key list NAMES
            lists all keys in the named virtual machines.


        List command can use the [--output=OUTPUT] option

            list the keys loaded to cloudmesh in the given format:
            json, yaml, table. table is default. The NAME can be
            specified and if omitted the name cloudmesh.profile.user
            is assumed.

    To get keys from the cloudmesh database the following commands are
    available:

        key delete NAMES
            deletes the Named keys. This may also have an impact on
            groups

        key rename NAME NEW
            renames the key from NAME to NEW in the cloudmesh database.

    Group management of keys is an important concept in cloudmesh,
    allowing multiple users to be added to virtual machines while
    managing the keys associated with them. The keys must be uploaded to
    cloudmesh database with a name so they can be used in a group.
    The --dryrun option executes the command without uploading the
    information to the clouds. If no group name is specified the group
    name default is assumed. If no cloudnamesh are specified, all active
    clouds are assumed. active clouds can be set in the cloudmesh.yaml
    file.

        key list [--group=GROUP] [--output=FORMAT]
            list the key taht are in the specified group.

        key group delete [NAMES] [--group=GROUPS]  [--dryrun]
            deletes the named keys from the named groups.


    In some cases you may want to store the public keys in files. For
    this reason we support the following commands.

        key add [NAME] [--group=GROUPS] [--source=FILENAME]
            adds the named file with the keys in the file to the groups.

        key export [--group=GROUPS] [--filename=FILENAME]
            the command exports the keys to the given group. The keys
            are written in the files in yaml format.

    Examples for keygroup commands:

        cms key add example --source=~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        cms key add --group=abc --name="laszewsk_git_[0-2]"
        cms key list
        cms key list --gropu=abc
        cms key export --file=~/authorized_keys --group=abc,klm
