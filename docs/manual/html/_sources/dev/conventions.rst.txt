Code Conventions
================

-  Python lint: All code must be formatted with the pyCHarm inspect
   method which will suggest a reformat with pyCharm and allows good
   error and python issue detection. Please fix as many as you can.

-  Printing errors:

   In case you need to print errors please do not use print, but use

   .. code:: python

      from cloudmesh.common.console import Console

      Console.error("this is an example")

-  Printing debug messages in verbose mode

   In case you like to do debug messages use

   .. code:: python

      from cloudmesh.DEBUG import VERBOSE

      VERBOSE("this is an example")  

-  Managing debug and verbose mode

   Verbosity and debugging can be controlled with

   .. code:: python

      cms set verbose=10
      cms set debug=True
      cms set trace=True

   anything that is smaller than 10 will be printed.
