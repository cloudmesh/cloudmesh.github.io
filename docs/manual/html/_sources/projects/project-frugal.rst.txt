Cloudmesh Frugal
================

-  This project can also be taken as independent study or as part of the
   Cloud Engineering class

Goals
-----

In this project you will be developing cloudmesh commands, APIâ€™s and
services to allow identification of the cheapest cloud option for
execution virtual machines, volumes, and other services.

Cloudmesh already includes information about vm pricing for AWS. You
will be extending this feature for other clouds such as AWS and Azure.
You will be exploring what other price information is available.

As the perfommance may be different between the systesm, you will also
develop a benchmark framework, that measure the prce of the ectual
executed programs, services, and datamovements so that the price can be
related to performance data.

Requirements
------------

Basic knowledge of python or a programming language as all programming
is done in python. Python is easy to learn. Access to the clouds.
Knowledge of beautiful soup and numpy is of advantage, but can be
obtained throughout the project.

Difficulty
----------

*moderate*: Obtaining price information may have to be done through Web
scraping. We provided an example for AWS sizes. You will be identifying
mechanism for finding prices form clouds. You will design a
specification template that lest users project estimated costs for their
appilcation. Benchmarking may be moderately more difficult than scraping

Deliverables
------------

-  Working cms command, API, and service
-  checkins into github by all team members. If only one team member
   checks in all other team members will not get credit.
-  Possible collaborate with *other* teams that work on clouds to
   jointly identify how pricing information can be identified.
-  This project must use AWS, Azure, and Google information
