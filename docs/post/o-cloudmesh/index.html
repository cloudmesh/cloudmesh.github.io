    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Cloudmesh is an important component to deliver a software-defined system
&ndash; encompassing virtualized and bare-metal infrastructure, networks,
application, systems and platform software &ndash; with a unifying goal of
providing Cloud Testbeds as a Service (CTaaS). Cloudmesh federates a
number of resources from academia and industry. This includes existing
FutureGrid infrastructure (4704 cores used by more than 355 projects),
Amazon Web Services, Azure, HP Cloud, Karlsruhe using various
technologies.</p>
<p><img src="images/cloudmesh-arch-2013.png" alt="Figure: The cloudmesh architecture. Green = components available,under improvement. Yellow = components underdevelopment."></p>
<p>A goal of Cloudmesh is to aggregate resources not only from FutureGrid,
but also from OpenCirrus, Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and HP Cloud and GENI
resources to name only a few. Cloudmesh was originally developed in
order to simplify the execution of multiple concurrent experiments on a
federated cloud infrastructure. In addition to virtual resources,
FutureGrid exposes bare-metal provisioning to users, but also a subset
of HPC monitoring infrastructure tools. Services will be available
through command line, API, and Web interfaces.</p>
<p>The three layers of the Cloudmesh architecture include a Cloudmesh
Management Framework for monitoring and operations, user and project
management, experiment planning and deployment of services needed by an
experiment, provisioning and execution environments to be deployed on
resources to (or interfaced with) enable experiment management, and
resources.</p>
<h2 id="system-monitoring-and-operations">System Monitoring and Operations</h2>
<p>The management framework contains services to facilitate FutureGrid
day-to-day operation, including federated or selective monitoring of the
infrastructure. Cloudmesh leverages FutureGrid for the operational
services and allows administrators to view ongoing system status and
experiments, as well as interact with users through ticket systems and
messaging queues to inform subscribed users on the status of the system.</p>
<p>The cloudmesh management framework offers services that simplify
integration of resources in the FutureGrid nucleus or through
federation. This includes, for user management, access to predefined
setup templates for services in enabling resource and service
provisioning as well as experiment execution. To integrate IaaS
frameworks cloudmesh offers two distinct services:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(a) a federated IaaS frameworks hosted on FutureGrid,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(b) the availability of a service that is hosted on FutureGrid
allowing the &ldquo;integration&rdquo; of IaaS frameworks through user
credentials either registered by the users or automatically obtained
from our distributed user directory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For (b) several toolkits exist to create user-based federations,
including our own abstraction level which supports interoperability via
libcloud, but more importantly it supports directly the native OpenStack
protocol and overcomes limitations of the EC2 protocol and the libcloud
compatibility layer. Plugins that we currently develop will enable
access to clouds via firewall penetration, abstraction layers for clouds
with few public IP addresses and integration with new services such as
OpenStack Heat. We successfully federated resources from Azure, AWS, the
HP cloud, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Cloud, and four FutureGrid
clouds using various versions of OpenStack and Eucalyptus. The same will
be done for OpenCirrus resources at GT and CMU through firewalls or
proxy servers.</p>
<p>Additional management flexibility will be introduced through automatic
cloud-bursting and shifting services. While cloud bursting will locate
empty resources in other clouds, cloud shifting will identify unused
services and resources, shut them down and provision them with services
that are requested by the users. We have demonstrated this concept in
2012, moving resources for ~100 users to services that were needed
based on class schedules. A reservation system will be used to allow for
reserved creation of such environments, along with improvements of
automation of cloud-shifting.</p>
<h2 id="user-and-project-services">User and Project Services</h2>
<p>FutureGrid user and project services simplify the application processes
needed to obtain user accounts and projects. We have demonstrated in
FutureGrid the ability to create accounts in a very short time,
including vetting projects and users &ndash; allowing fast turn-around times
for the majority of FutureGrid projects with an initial startup
allocation. Cloudmesh re-uses this infrastructure and also allows users
to manage proxy accounts to federate to other IaaS services to provide
an easy interface to integrate them.</p>
<h3 id="accounting-and-app-store">Accounting and App Store</h3>
<p>To lower the barrier of entry Cloudmesh will be providing a shopping
cart which will allow checking out of predefined repeatable experiment
templates. A cost is associated with an experiment making it possible to
engage in careful planning and to save time by reusing previous
experiments. Additionally, the Cloudmesh App Store may function as a
clearing-house of images, image templates, services offered and
provisioning templates. Users may package complex deployment
descriptions in an easy parameter/form-based interface and other users
may be able to replicate the specified setup with.</p>
<p>Due to our advanced Cloudmesh Metrics framework we are in the position
to further develop an integrated accounting framework allowing a usage
cost model for users and management to identify the real impact of an
experiment on resources. This will be useful to avoid overprovisioning
and inefficient resource usage. The cost model will be based not only on
number of core hours used, but also the capabilities of the resource,
the time, and special support it takes to set up the experiment. We will
expand upon the metrics framework of FutureGrid that allows measuring of
VM and HPC usage and associate this with cost models. Benchmarks will be
used to normalize the charge models.</p>
<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>
<p>We have a broad vision of resource integration in FutureGrid with
systems offering different levels of control from &quot;bare metal&quot; to use
of a portion of a resource. Likewise, we must utilize networks offering
various levels of control, from standard IP connectivity to completely
configurable SDNs as novel cloud architectures will almost certainly
leverage NaaS and SDN alongside system software and middleware.
FutureGrid resources will make use of SDN using OpenFlow whenever
possible and the same level of networking control will not be available
in every location.</p>
<h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>
<p>To serve the purposes of CISE researchers, Cloudmesh must be able to
access empirical data about the properties and performance of the
underlying infrastructure beyond what is available from commercial cloud
environments. To accommodate this requirement we have developed a
uniform access interface to virtual machine monitoring information
available for OpenStack, Eucalyptus, and Nimbus. In the future, we will
be enhancing the access to historical user information. Right now they
are exposed through predefined reports that we create on a regular
basis. To achieve this we will also leverage the ongoing work while
using the AMPQ protocol. Furthermore, Cloudmesh will provide access to
common monitoring infrastructure as provided by Ganglia, Nagios, Inca,
perfSonar, PAPI and others.</p>
<h3 id="role-and-use-of-standards-and-open-source-software">Role and Use of Standards and Open Source Software</h3>
<p>Cloudmesh will use standards and open source software as part of its
design principles towards sustainability. We will leverage efforts such
as OCCI and CDMI and are already using community efforts on
interoperability APIs as provided by Apache libcloud. However, as
libcloud is feature limited Cloudmesh provides an additional abstraction
layer that exposes cloud interfaces on the native-protocol level.
Furthermore we interface to commercial Clouds such as Microsoft Azure,
Amazon WS, and HP Cloud to providing access to robust commercial high
availability services.</p>
