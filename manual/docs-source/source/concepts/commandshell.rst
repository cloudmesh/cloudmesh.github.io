Extensible Command Shell
========================

In contrast to simple commandline tools for cloud providers. cloudmesh
provides not just commandlines, but also a command shell at the same
time. The command line execution si simply the execution of the
command shell with a given set of inputs.

Through this concept you can create cloudmesh **scripts** that can be
executed easily, in case you need a sequence of commands that need to
be replicated.

For more details on this please see our implementation of cmd5 at the


* `CMD5 Manual page <../cmd5.html>`__
