OpenAPI Web Services
====================

Cloudmesh contains a menanism to automatically generate REST services
from simple python functions and classes.

The details about this concept is discussed at:

* https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-openapi/blob/master/README.md

The generated code insludes a simple REST service, as well as the
needed OpenAPI 3 yaml file so it can be used for generationg clients
in arbitrary languages. It also allows the documented display of the
REST service.
