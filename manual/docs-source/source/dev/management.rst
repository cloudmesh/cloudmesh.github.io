Code Management
---------------

At this time we recommend and require that you use ``pyCharm`` community
edition or professional to edit your code. Before committing we like that
you run ``Inspect Code`` on all files that you commit and fix as many
errors as possible including PEP8 format suggestions. It also notifies
you of issues you may not think about while doing other code inspection.

The reason we ask you to do so is that pycharms code inspection is very
good, and that if everyone uses pycharm the format of the code is
uniform and we do not run in to formatting issues.

This will make the review of any code contributed much easier.

Naturally you can use a different editor for your work, but we still ask
you to use pycharm to fix formatting and code inspection before you
commit.

Typically we run a code inspection every week.
