`Cloudmesh <https://cloudmesh-community.github.io/cm/>`__ is
an evolution of our previous tool that has been used by hundreds of
students and cloud practitioners to interact easily with clouds to
create a service mashup to access common cloud services across a number
of cloud providers.

It is under active development and managed in github at

- Documentation: https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/
