Cloudmesh Local Compute and Storage
===================================

-  This is a miniproject
-  This project can also be taken as independent study or as part of the
   Cloud Engineering class however additional work is required as part
   of another project or miniprojects.

Goals
-----

In this project you will be developing cloudmesh commands, APIâ€™s and
services to simulate a cloud on your local machine or any other machine
that is reachable via the ip address.

You will be implementing a cloudmesh compute and storage provider. This
will help for debugging purposes to other projects if now cloud is
available.

Requirements
------------

Basic knowledge of python or a programming language as all programming
is done in python. Python is easy to learn.

Difficulty
----------

*very easy*: This is a very easy project. Hence it is classified as
miniproject.

Deliverables
------------

-  Working cms command, API, and service
-  checkins into github by all team members. If only one team member
   checks in all other team members will not get credit.
-  Possible collaborate with *other* teams that work on clouds to
   jointly identify how pricing information can be identified.
-  This project must use AWS, Azure, and Google information
-  You must use the parallel ssh available in cloudmesh.common.Host. You
   will enhance this to enable scp also.
-  You will be defining extensive pytests for this and other
   functionality. See the test_ping.py fro an example
