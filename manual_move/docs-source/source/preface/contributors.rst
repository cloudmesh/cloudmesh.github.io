Many have contributed to Cloudmesh in the past.  However, this version has
received contributions from a subset of them. Previous contributors are
acknowledged once we integrate them into the author script.

Contributors are *sorted by the first letter of their combined first name and
last name* and if not available by their GitHub ID. Please, note that the
authors are identified through git logs in addition to some contributors added
by hand. The git repository from which this document is derived contains more
than the documents included in this document. Thus not everyone in this list
may have directly contributed to this document. Furthermore, names may appear
that have not contributed to the production code, but to some intermediary code
or spelling corrections. However, if you find someone missing that has
contributed (they may not have used this particular git), please let us know. We
will add you.


The contributors sorted by the firstname that we are aware of include:
