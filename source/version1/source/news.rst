======================================================================

We are happy to announce the alpha release of cloudmesh. Cloudmesh is
capable of interfacing with clouds and HPC frameworks. We have
successfully demonstarted by our developers usage of

* OpenStack Clouds on FutureGrid (India, Sierra, Alamo)
* AWS
* Azure
* HP Cloud
* Karlsruhe Institute of Technolgy Cloud

At this time we only expose the FutuureGrid Sierra OpenStack cloud. We
like to acknowledge all those that helped us developing Cloudmesh.

Thanks

Gregor von Laszewski and the rest of 

`the cloudmesh team </git>`_.
